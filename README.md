# Prox-seq_computation
A computational framework for simulating and analyzing Prox-seq data

For introduction to Prox-seq, including how to align Prox-seq sequencing data, visit https://github.com/tay-lab/Prox-seq

All relevant functions and classes are included in [ProxseqClasses.py](https://github.com/tay-lab/Prox-seq_computation/blob/main/ProxseqClasses.py). To use them, simply download the py files to your working directory.

For a tutorial on how to use the framework, please refer to [Prox-seq_simulation_tutorial.ipynb](https://github.com/tay-lab/Prox-seq_computation/blob/main/Prox-seq_simulation_tutorial.ipynb).
